## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- Blue frame for active stage (not just brighter gray) -- must be instantly distinguishable without biasing color perception
- Used muted steel-blue #4488cc for active stage border -- visible but desaturated enough to avoid biasing color perception
- Thumbnail area is a button, outer card is a plain div -- cleanest click target separation
- Used Tailwind v4 @theme directive for surface palette
- Used inline select for pipeline-specific numeric dropdowns since grading/Select is string-generic
